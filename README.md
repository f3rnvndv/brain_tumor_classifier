# 🧠 Brain Tumor Classifier

This project uses a **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** to classify brain MRI images into **4 categories**:

- Normal brain
- Brain with meningioma tumor
- Brain with pituitary tumor
- Brain with glioma tumor

---

## 📊 Dataset

**Brain Tumor MRI Dataset (Kaggle)**  
- Contains **7,023 human brain MRI images** divided into 4 classes:
  - Glioma
  - Meningioma
  - No tumor
  - Pituitary

- Default dataset split:
  - **Training:** 5,712 images (80%)  
  - **Test:** 1,143 images (20%)

- Training and validation split:
  - An **80-20 split** was kept to avoid reducing the training data too much.
  - **Training:** 4,569 images  
  - **Validation:** 1,143 images  
  - **Test:** 1,311 images
